Scaling involves resizing an image, making it larger or smaller while maintaining its proportions. Scaling can be uniform (scaling both width and height by the same factor) or non-uniform (scaling width and height independently). Scaling is essential for adjusting image sizes for different display resolutions, printing, and optimizing data storage.
